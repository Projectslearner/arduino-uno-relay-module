# Arduino Uno Relay Module with Serial Monitor Output

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a relay module using an Arduino Uno and monitor its status using the Serial Monitor. A relay is an electrically operated switch that allows you to control high-power devices with a low-power signal.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Relay Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Relay Module to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal input of the relay module to digital pin 7 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the VCC and GND of the relay module to the 5V and GND of the Arduino, respectively.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the relay module to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the messages indicating the state of the relay (ON or OFF).

#### Applications

- **Home Automation:** Control lights, fans, or other appliances remotely.
- **Industrial Control:** Interface with high-power devices using Arduino.
- **Experimentation:** Learn about relay operation and control in circuits.

#### Notes

- Ensure the relay module is rated appropriately for the devices you intend to control.
- Check the datasheet of your relay module for correct wiring and operational limits.
- Use external power sources or relays with optocouplers for higher reliability and isolation.
